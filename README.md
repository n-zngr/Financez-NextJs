## Documentation
Documentation of the project is not public, found on Notion. 

## Purpose
I've been looking for an application that allows me to track my finances, separate to my e-banking but couldn't find a solution that I like. 
Learning React and NextJs has been on my bucket-list. I thought this is a good opportunity to learn a new framework, building something that I will use in the future.
